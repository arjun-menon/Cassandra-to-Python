Cassandra Translator
====================

Translates from Datalog-C to Python. The Datalog-C is specific to the Cassandra system described in [Moritz Becker's thesis]([example link](http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=76079). Currently a work in progress.

Usage
-----
Run `main.py`. The generated Python rules will appear in the directory `ehr`.
