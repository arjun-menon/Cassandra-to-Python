There's a whole bunch of roles, each role has something to do with who each person is and defines what he can do.
 - Spine contains a bunch of roles - spine clinician, etc. So do the others.
 - Generate a list of all roles in spine, hospital, etc.
 * You need a REPL that will let you list these roles,
