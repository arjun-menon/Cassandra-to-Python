Cassandra EHR Translator
========================
Arjun G. Menon


Getting it
-----------

A zipball of the entire source for the translator and translated EHR as well as the original EHR
 and library dependencies of the translator can be obtained at:

https://github.com/novarc/Cassandra/zipball/master

Additionally, you can browse the source code online at:

https://github.com/novarc/Cassandra


Running it
-----------

Simply run 'translator.py' with a Py3k interpreter.

The code has been developed using CPython 3.2, so I do not know if it will work with earlier 
versions of py3k.

Upon execution, the translation should print out something like:

-------------------
Translating 137 rules in spine...
Done. Wrote to spine.py

Translating 35 rules in pds...
Done. Wrote to pds.py

Translating 168 rules in hospital...
Done. Wrote to hospital.py

Translating 37 rules in ra...
Done. Wrote to ra.py
-------------------

This signifies successful translation.

The translated files are output to the folder 'ehr'.
